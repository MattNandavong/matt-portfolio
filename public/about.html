    <h1>Who am I?</h1>
    <p>
      Hey there! I’m Chidpasong Nandavong a recent Master of IT (Software Development)
      graduate who loves turning ideas into real, working apps and websites.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’ve been building mobile apps with Flutter and creating responsive web
      designs, with some hands-on experience in Python and JavaScript for
      backend development. I enjoy experimenting with new tools and technologies
      that make coding smoother and more fun.
    </p>

    <p>
      Right now, I’m looking for opportunities as a Junior Software Developer or
      Mobile App Engineer, where I can keep learning, collaborate with others,
      and help build projects that make a difference.
    </p>
